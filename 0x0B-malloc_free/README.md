Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str.
 
Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.

On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available.
